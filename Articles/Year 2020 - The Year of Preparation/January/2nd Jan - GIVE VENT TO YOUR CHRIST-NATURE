To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory  (Colossians 1:27). 

The real essence of Christianity is Christ in you, manifesting and expressing Himself in, and through you. The Christian is one who expresses and demonstrates the life, nature, character and righteousness of Christ. This is one of the things you check in appraising yourself spiritually; how much your actions, attitude, words and character epitomise Christ. 

For example, when you’re offended, do you give vent to your Christ-nature or allow your flesh to gain the upper hand? As one who’s born again, Christ rules your life; you have His nature. Therefore, in all you do, and at all times, refuse to yield to the flesh; rather, respond from your Christ-nature. 

When you talk, let Christ be heard. Let His love effuse from your words and actions. Let His wisdom mantle your hearers as you speak only gracious and lifting words; let Him talk through you. Let Him see through your eyes, walk with your legs and work with your hands. 2 Corinthians 4:11 says, “For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.” This is Christianity. 

All that God wants manifested in you is Christ; touching and changing lives through you. The prophet said, “…he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days…” (Isaiah 53:10); you’re that seed. Hallelujah! You reveal the glory and beauty of Christ. That glory is in your spirit, where Christ dwells. Therefore, look inwards; see the glory within and reveal the same to your world.

CONFESSION
I have a new life and nature—the life and nature of God. I was recreated in righteousness and true holiness, to express the will and nature of the Father. In every matter, in every place, at every opportunity, I give expression to the righteousness of God. Amen.

23 And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude],

24 And put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God’s image, [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness.

25 Therefore, rejecting all falsity and being done now with it, let everyone express the truth with his neighbor, for we are all parts of one body and members one of another.;
